### Requirements
* Jupyter Notebook (Anaconda)
* PostgreSQL

### Task: 
To determine whether to focus on enhancing mobile app experience or website of an ecommerce company and to train a model to predict yearly amount spent by the users.

### Results:
* An increase in the Length of Membership would result in the biggest impact of the value of our customers for Yearly Amount Spent.
* Second to Length of Membership is Time on the App. 
* The website needs more work compared to the time on the app to bring website up to speed. 
* Length of Membership should be considered in the evaluation of whether to spend time on developing the app or the website. 

### Insights
A linear regression analysis was performed for an ecommerce company to help them decide between focusing on their app experience or their website. 

The model showed that the app currently has greater profitability for one more minute increase compared to the time on the website.

An economical analysis would need to be done to further analyze which of the two would be more profitable: bringing the website up or developing the app further in efforts to increase time on either.

Alongside this,however, Length of Membership was the greatest impacter in the amount a customer spent yearly, meaning that the longer the customers stay with the company, the more money the company will make in the long run.
