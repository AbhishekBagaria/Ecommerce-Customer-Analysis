### Task: 
To determine whether to focus on enhancing mobile app experience or website of an ecommerce company and to train a model to predict yearly amount spent by the users.

### Results:
An increase in the Length of Membership would result in the biggest impact of the value of our customers for Yearly Amount Spent. It's good to remember that Length of Membership is measure in years. Second to Length of Membership is Time on the App. With the question of what they should focus on between the website and the app, it depends on what the costs of developing the app vs. the website are. It's clear that the website needs more work compared to the time on the app, but it may be more cost effective to continue working on the App instead of bringing the website up to speed. Economic factors would determine which course of action to take, but at least we now have knowledge of the state of our website and our app in terms of yearly spend per customer. Above this, we also found that Length of Membership produced the most impact to a customer's Yearly Amount Spent and should be considered in the evaluation of whether to spend time on developing the app or the website.
